you can start edit `src/main.cpp`

## how to run the app?

1. you need to install [cmake](https://cmake.org/download)

2. create new folder `bulid` in the main directory and go inside it and run cmake command

```cmd
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

3. then you can go outside the directory and run cmake build command

```cmd
cd ..
cmake --build build
```

4. then you will find an executable here `build/app.exe`, you can simply run it

```cmd
./build/app
```

### NOTE: every time you make changes run cmake build command

```cmd
cmake --build build
./build/app
```
